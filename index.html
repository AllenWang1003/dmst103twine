    <br> <br> Role for this Job: Researching poential uptrend ESG companies. Meansing of ESG is: Environemnt, Social, Goverence, and this means that I am looking for those 
    companies that not only do their job running businesss but also keeping the sustainable factor of ESG along the way. 
    
    <br> <br> With this being said, my job is also related to sustainability (looking for sustainability, to be more specific), and what is being fundemental is that 
    people can be very familiar with some of the companies that I have done the researches. For example, APPLE, TELSA, LONGi (solar panel)...
